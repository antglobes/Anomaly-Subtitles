	<!-- Here i swapped "dumb" and "only", because I think it's better, no real translation reason for me
	And in the end "it's like what" don't really fit because meaning of the line that bandit says is: "What is it about?"
	I changed it to "What is it even about" adding "even" was because bandint used "Tipo" for it equivalent in English will be "like"
	but here it used more like meaningless,  filler-word so I used "even" as such, you of couse can find better word
	And for the "confused" in my personal opinion for the bandit there will be better simplier "didn't get it" because I don't think bandits really use much words like "confused"-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_joke_reaction_joke_1">
		<text>Guys, am I the only dumbass, or did nobody else get it? What was it even about?</text> // changed 'only one dumb here' to 'only dumbass here' to better reflect rough bandit tone, 'is everyone else didn't get it' to 'did nobody else get it' to better flow / 'nobody' for more informal tone, replaced ',' after 'get it' to '?' to better tone 
	</string>
	<!-- so here "mould", as you probably undersood is in the meaning of "guy who told a old joke", nor really need a change, just comment here 
	and not leaving first phrase, will add here "well", again like the filler-word, because bandit uses one "Nu" -->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_joke_reaction_joke_2">
		<text>Well, you're a geezer! You could have told me about Stirlitz!</text> // 'mould' to 'geezer' to better reflect 'old joker'. replaced ',' after geezer with '!' to better flow
	</string>
	<!-- "Ha-ha. That's hilarious, I am rolling on the floor."
	I saved on the first line of the comment original translation I think it's not bad, it's just too long,
	because bandit keps his comment short in this line, so to shorten it i will use not "that hillarious" but short "funny"
	and of the line has meaning of "I just can't stop laughing" but in sarcastic way, I leave it as "I just can't" maybe you will find something better-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_joke_reaction_joke_3">
		<text>Ha-ha. Funny. A real knee-slapper.</text> // 'I just can't' to 'that's a real knee-slapper' to reinforce sarcasm 
	</string>
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_1">
		<text>Mn, really gets to the soul...</text> // replaced 'ugh' with 'mn' to reinforce contemplative tone, added 'the' before 'soul' for emphasis, ellipsis after 'soul' to further reinforce contemplative tone 
	</string>
	<!-- So here is missing a few words, first "Kich" meaning "jail/prison" and I don't know from where comes quote about death
	but in the source bandit says word with the meaning of "become rooster" and "rooster" in the bandit jargon means "gay" or something like "low-class"
	And to be clear "passive gay" means who is bean fucked, for your knowlage only. So I changed it like this "you'd have been fucked long ago"-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_2">
		<text>Yeah, Cupcake. If you played like that in prison, you'd be fucked long ago.</text> // removed 'the' before 'prison' and replaced 'have been' with 'be' to reinforce bandit colloquial tone
	</string>
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_3">
		<text>That oughtta make waterfalls..</text>  // idk what 'forestfall' means. if it's to evoke sadness, then i replaced the whole statement to reflect that
	</string>
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_4">
		<text>We didn't have any shit to play on when we were in juvie.</text> // im assumming he meant he was in prison as a kid, replaced with us-central slang for juvenile-detention called 'juvie.' open to edits on this to make it less us-centric
	</string>
	<!-- Yes, here bandit sings about lavander, reference to Sofia Rotaru - Lavander
	But in any case I think there is no need for the other translation-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_5">
		<text>Lavender!... Mountain lavender!</text> 
	</string>
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_6">
		<text>No, no, no! That's not it, not an inch! No, you're kidding!</text> // replaced ',' after last 'no' in trio for emphasis and edited capitalized subsequent 'that' to make seperate clause, replaced ',' after inch with '!' to reinforce tone, capitalized 'no' subsequently for seperate clause. contracted 'you' and 'are' to reinforce bandit colloquial tone. 
	</string>
	<!--Having a hard time understanding where goes where, because bandit talks so fast
	but here what I noticed there is not "I didn't relise", bandit says "I clearly didn't get it" implying that he's for sure didn't understand here
	I deleted "like" because again "tipo" filler-word don't think "like" fits here as one
	and lastly bandit not just talks about music that have been played, but about music in general that like this so I changed "Fuck that music" to "Fuck music like this"-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_music_reaction_music_7">
		<text>No, no - well.. guys, wait. I clearly didn't get it, that was a song? Fuck that music!</text> // replaced ',' after second 'no' to '-', replaced ',' after 'well' with ellipsis, replaced ',' after wait with '.' to better convey pause. replaced 'music' with song' in first instance to better differentiate dislike this particular song. replaced 'it' with 'that' before 'song' to better convey that the songs not still occuring in conversation 
	</string>
	<!-- Only what I will change here is "How good you joked" change it to ", "good one" because of the simplicity and what bandit says is "Well, you gave"
	With the meaning of "You joked good", and I didn't add "Well" because I don't think it fits here like filer-word
	And here "pal" is not bad, because used here ""demon" was not ment in the bad way, more like friendly nickname-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_story_laughter_1">
		<text>Gha-ga-ga-ga-gaaa-ha-ha-haha-ha! good one Knuckles, really, I swear!</text> // removed ',' before 'pal' to better flow, replaced 'pal' with 'knuckles' to better convey rough-and-tumble, positive nickname
	</string>
	<!-- outside of the filler-words that can be added here, I will note that in the end here said is "Well, you really" not just "really"-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_story_laughter_2">
		<text>Ha ha ha! No, you're a pure comedian, really!</text>
	</string>
	<!-- Don't really understand what hecker is doing here, but here is again like in the laighter_1 friendly nickname
	I will use here "demon", but I think you can find something better
	other that it I will change wotrding here to be more on line with what is actually been side, like messing "Mla"
	In the end it will be "demon, heck, reall demon" in the first phrase I deleted "you" because there is no addressing word
	and "really a" to "real" for simplicity-->
	<string id="as_sub_characters_voice_human_bandit_1_reactions_story_laughter_3">
		<text>Gha-gag-agha-gA-gah, bad boy, heck - a real bad-boy!</text> // changed 'demon' to 'bad-boy' to reinforce rough-and-tumble tone
	</string>
	<!-- There is used word "Тащусь" that can be described as "enjoing something very much", here in this context I think translation is not bad -->
