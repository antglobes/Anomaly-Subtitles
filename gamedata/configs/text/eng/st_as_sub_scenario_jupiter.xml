		<text>I'll tell you all about the bloodsuckers, I'll explain. As I was at Zaton's recently, everyone there was getting sick of those nipples. Stalker's brother poor bastard fucks with them day and night, and to make a it's not working. Result at zero. So I decided to help the guys out. I took a shotgun and went straight to the lair. Before the bloodsuckers come to visit. And for three days I gave them such a party, oh me! I've had to light two or three at once. Anyway, after my bloodsucker discos at the Zaton I'm not. They've picked up their feelers now. </text>

		<text>I'll tell you how to take out the controllers. I'd recently acquired a bunch of artefacts, so I figured to discount them on the call. On the way back, I come to the stash. And there's a controller in there, and he's not going to leave. Here's Marro-ka on the spot, controller not controller, and I have to pick up the Habar, and I'm having an epiphany. If, I think, I close myself up with some kind of ironclad thing, I'm gonna have to do everything I don't give a shit about his antics, and knowing that I do. I take the metal grate that was lying around, and I use it so I'm just gonna close up on a quiet ramble. And so while I'm grazing, while I'm getting my brains wired, while I was wondering why I was so insensitive, I was already and he came close, and fell on my head. He's a hardy bastard, but I just threw the bars off, he's gonna kick my brains out, but I'm gonna hit him with the butt of my gun, he's quieted down right away. </text>

All is quiet, like my late grandmother's cottage. And the artefacts are like cucumbers, one on top of the other lying shovelfuls of mushrooms.

The professors were all shocked when they saw me. Well, they say you're just the kind of guy we need. Why do I ask? Turns out they've got to put their gadgets under the anomalies. These goggle-eyed men themselves don't want to go, of course? Well, they promised bobos and goodies and stuff. It's okay, I don't care. You were good. Well, then I had to crawl around the neighbourhood. Anomalies, monomalies. Well, that's okay. That's normal stalker bullshit.

You know, we wanted to kill the chimera, but we had to show him the altitude of the flight. I went straight to the vlog of one just outside the entrance, as always set it up, herd when the chimera comes back to signal me, and he fell asleep in the morning and missed the chimera I got off my arse when I saw it, I had to do it myself to fight back, but I did, as you can see. </text>
